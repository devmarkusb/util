Contains sublibs that are topic- and implementation-wise
-more fundamental
-more self-contained - allow dependencies at most among themselves exclusively
-more widely usable
-more well-selected and separated
than parts of toolib, which is more an all-purpose helper for larger
applications, rather than libraries or tools that strive for
reduced dependencies.

For these naturally smaller pieces of ToolsFoundationLayers,
also called tfl = ToolsFoundationLibrary,
it is well permitted practice to use each other (of course excluding
cyclic dependencies) in appropriate manner.
So naturally a dependency graph with different layers of dependencies
emerges.

REQUIREMENT:
Higher level libs dependent on tfl have to be checked
out next to tfl.
