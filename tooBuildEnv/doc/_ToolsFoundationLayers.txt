Contains repos with libs that are topic- and implementation-wise
-more fundamental
-more self-contained - allow dependencies at most among themselves exclusively
-more widely usable
-more well-selected and separated
than parts of Toolib, which is more an all-purpose helper for larger
applications, rather than libraries or tools that strive for
reduced dependencies.

For these naturally smaller pieces of ToolsFoundationLayers (ToolsFL)
it is well permitted practice to use each other (of course excluding
cyclic dependencies) in appropriate manner.
So naturally a dependency graph with different layers of dependencies
emerges.

REQUIREMENT:
Dependent lib-repos must be checked out next to each other under a parent
directy named ToolsFL.
So furthermore, higher lever libs dependent on ToolsFL have to be checked
out next to ToolsFL.
Note: The submodule approach ends in the disaster of multiple builds and
tests of the same library within a project that uses several of the
ToolsFL libraries.
